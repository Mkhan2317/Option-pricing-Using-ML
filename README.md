# Machine Learning for Option Pricing

## Overview

This repository explores the use of machine learning techniques to predict the prices of vanilla put options. As financial markets evolve, traditional models like Black-Scholes may no longer adequately capture option pricing dynamics. This project evaluates various machine learning models to address these challenges and provide more accurate price predictions.

## Research Summary

In this research, we generate a dataset based on the Black-Scholes model and apply different machine learning models to forecast option prices. The models examined include:

- **Neural Networks**: Achieved outstanding out-of-sample performance by capturing complex nonlinear relationships.
- **Tree-based Models**: Includes Random Forests and Gradient Boosted Trees, which offer high accuracy and interpretability.
- **Linear Regression**: Serves as a baseline model to highlight limitations in capturing the complexities of option pricing.

## Features

- **Dataset Generation**: Code to create a synthetic dataset rooted in the Black-Scholes model.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Implementation of various machine learning algorithms, including Neural Networks, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosted Trees, and Linear Regression.
- **Performance Comparison**: Tools to assess and compare the predictive performance of different models.
